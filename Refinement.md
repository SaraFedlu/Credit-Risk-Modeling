## Step-by-Step Analysis of the Notebooks

### 1. EDA Notebook  
**What’s in the Notebook:**  
- **Data Understanding:** The notebook loads the raw dataset and displays key information like the number of rows, columns, data types, and summary statistics.  
- **Visualization of Numerical Features:** Histograms and box plots are used to show distributions, detect skewness, and identify potential outliers.  
- **Categorical Analysis:** Bar charts and frequency counts are displayed to analyze categorical features’ variability.  
- **Correlation Analysis & Missing Values:** A correlation matrix is generated, and missing values are identified with visual cues.  

**Accomplishments:**  
- Solid data exploration that lays the foundation for feature engineering and modeling.  
- Good initial insight into data distributions and relationships.


### 2. Feature Engineering Notebook  
**What’s in the Notebook:**  
- **Aggregate Feature Creation:** The notebook calculates total transaction amounts, average amounts, transaction counts, and standard deviations per customer.  
- **Extraction of Temporal Features:** New features like transaction hour, day, month, and year are derived from timestamp data.  
- **Categorical Variable Encoding:** Techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding are applied to convert categorical data into numerical form.  
- **Handling Missing Values & Normalization:** Strategies for imputing or removing missing data are implemented, and numerical features are normalized/standardized.  
- **Application of Specialized Libraries:** Although references to libraries like [xverse](https://pypi.org/project/xverse/) and [woe](https://pypi.org/project/woe/) are mentioned, their full integration (with clear output displays) may still need further refinement.

**Accomplishments:**  
- Comprehensive creation of engineered features that enhance model input.  
- Preliminary integration of normalization and transformation techniques.


### 3. Modeling Notebook  
**What’s in the Notebook:**  
- **Default Estimator & WoE Binning (Task 4):**  
  - The notebook attempts to visualize transactions in the RFMS space to set a decision boundary for categorizing users into “good” and “bad” credit groups.  
  - A basic implementation of WoE binning is present but could benefit from more detailed visualizations and explanation of the threshold-setting process.  

- **Model Selection and Training (Task 5):**  
  - Logistic Regression and Random Forest are trained on the dataset.  
  - The notebook splits the data into training and test sets and applies hyperparameter tuning techniques (Grid Search/Random Search).  
  - Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC are calculated and displayed.  

- **Outputs and Visualizations:**  
  - Comparative performance plots (or tables) help illustrate model performance across the selected metrics.  
  - Some insights into model strengths and weaknesses are drawn from these visual outputs.

**Accomplishments:**  
- Functional training and evaluation of several predictive models.  
- Initial establishment of a default estimator, though the boundary in RFMS space requires clearer visualization and documentation.
